00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Day of the Dead

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I arrive in Guatemala on the Day of the Dead, November 1st.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm curious about this holiday, so I go to the cemetery to see what's happening.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What I find is quite interesting.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The atmosphere is like a party.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
There are people everywhere.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Families are sitting around the graves of their dead ancestors.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
They clean the graves and add fresh flowers.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I walk through the cemetery and admire the beauty of all the colorful flowers.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
There's also color in the sky because many kids are flying kites.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Some families are having a picnic next to the graves.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
They eat, drink, and chat together.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
People laugh and smile.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
In the United States, cemeteries are always somber.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We certainly never have festivals or parties next to graves.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We don't laugh or play music or fly kites in cemeteries either.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I find that I prefer the Guatemalan approach.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I like the way they remember and celebrate those who have passed away.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I like that they acknowledge death instead of denying it the way Americans do.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I like that there is life as well as death in their cemeteries.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Guatemalans call it the Day of the Dead, but it is also a day to appreciate life.
